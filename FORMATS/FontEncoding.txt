@page mdbFontEncoding Font Encoding

@section font-encoding-description DESCRIPTION

The m17n library loads information about the encoding of each font
form the m17n database by the tags \<font, encoding\>.  The data is
loaded as a plist of this format.

@verbatim
FONT-ENCODING ::= PER-FONT *

PER-FONT ::= '(' FONT-SPEC ENCODING [ REPERTORY ] ')'

FONT-SPEC ::=
    '(' [ FOUNDRY FAMILY
    	  [ WEIGHT [ STYLE [ STRETCH [ ADSTYLE ]]]]]
	REGISTRY ')'

ENCODING ::= SYMBOL
@endverbatim

@c FONT-SPEC is to specify properties of a font.  @c FOUNDRY to @c
REGISTRY are symbols corresponding to #Mfoundry to #Mregistry property
of a font.  See @ref m17nFont for the meaning of each property.

For instance, this @c FONT-SPEC:

@verbatim
    (nil alice0\ lao iso8859-1)
@endverbatim

should be applied to all fonts whose family name is "alice0 lao", and
registry is "iso8859-1".

@c ENCODING is a symbol representing a charset.  A font matching @c
FONT-SPEC supports all characters of the charset, and a character code
is mapped to the corresponding glyph code of the font by this charset.

@c REPERTORY is a symbol representing a charset or "nil".  Omitting it
is the same as specifying @c ENCODING as @c REPERTORY.  If it is not
"nil", the charset specifies the repertory of the font, i.e, which
character it supports.  Otherwise, whether a specific character is
supported by the font or not is asked to each font driver.

For so called Unicode fonts (registry is "iso10646-1"), it is
recommended to specify "nil" as @c REPERTORY because such fonts
usually supports only a subset of Unicode characters.  */
