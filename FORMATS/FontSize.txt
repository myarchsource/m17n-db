@page mdbFontSize Font Size

@section font-size-description DESCRIPTION

In some case, a font contains incorrect information about its size
(typically in the case of a hacked TrueType font), which results in a
bad text layout when such a font is used in combination with the other
fonts.  To overcome this problem, the m17n library loads information
about font-size adjustment from the m17n database by the tags \<font,
resize\>.  The data is loaded as a plist of this format.

@verbatim
FONT-SIZE-ADJUSTMENT ::= PER-FONT *

PER-FONT ::= '(' FONT-SPEC ADJUST-RATIO ')'

FONT-SPEC ::=
    '(' [ FOUNDRY FAMILY
    	  [ WEIGHT [ STYLE [ STRETCH [ ADSTYLE ]]]]]
	REGISTRY ')'

ADJUST-RATIO ::= INTEGER
@endverbatim

@c FONT-SPEC is to specify properties of a font.  @c FOUNDRY to @c
REGISTRY are symbols corresponding to #Mfoundry to #Mregistry property
of a font.  See @ref m17nFont for the meaning of each property.

@c ADJUST-RATIO is an integer number specifying by percentage how much
the font-size must be adjusted.  For instance, this @c PER-FONT:

@verbatim
    ((devanagari-cdac) 150)
@endverbatim

instructs the font handler of the m17n library to open a font of 1.5
times bigger than a requested size on opening a font whose registry
is "devanagari-cdac".
